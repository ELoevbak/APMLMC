This repository contains Python scripts used for the development of a multilevel Monte Carlo method for asymptotic-preserving particle schemes for kinetic equations.

This is not intended to be a software library, but is simply a publication of code used for producing the papers. As such, documentation is minimal, but you can reach me at emil.loevbak@kuleuven.be if you want more information. In the future, I hope to release a more mature implementation of these schemes.
